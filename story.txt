Alexander said "Sometimes you come to a point in your life where it seems like nothing is certain, like everything you know might not be the way you think. Maybe that's just life, uncertainty. Maybe that's what makes it so exciting... we'llnever know". And with those words, he left us all pondering, what is life?
Just then Reed walked into the room. He walks over to Alex and I, puts his arm around our shoulders and says "You know guys... I think I might have done it." We both look at him wondering what he could possibly be talking about this time.
Reed leads us to the kitchet where he has made, what seems like, the perfect cake.  It had wonderful frosting with many decorations.  It had multiple layers and it clearly took lots of time to make this.  Reed says, "I need your help carrying this".
