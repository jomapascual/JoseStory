Alexander said "Sometimes you come to a point in your life where it seems like nothing is certain, like everything you know might not be the way you think. Maybe that's just life, uncertainty. Maybe that's what makes it so exciting... we'llnever know". And with those words, he left us all pondering, what is life?
Just then Reed walked into the room. He walks over to Alex and I, puts his arm around our shoulders and says "You know guys... I think I might have done it." We both look at him wondering what he could possibly be talking about this time.
Reed leads us to the kitchet where he has made, what seems like, the perfect cake.  It had wonderful frosting with many decorations.  It had multiple layers and it clearly took lots of time to make this.  Reed says, "I need your help carrying this". Alex replies "Where to, boss." "Over into the other room." Alex followed Reed with the cake, its massive layers towering over them. The towering of cake and frosting, started shifting, slowly sliding off the board. The soft cake exploded on contact with the floor. Reed seeing his day's work destroyed sat down and stared. Alexander thought he could see a tear forming in Reed's eye. The two friends now went over to Reed to console him for what had happened, they could only imagine how disappointed Reed was since he had been working on it all day. After a little talking, Reed was already feeling a lot better. And in a few minutes, they all decided to make a cake together and that it would a lot better than the first cake. With that they had an awesome day together and realized that life is just how we relate to others.
